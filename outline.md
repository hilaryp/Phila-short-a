Educational attainment and the retreat from the Philadelphia short-a system

1. Introduction
    * Socioeconomic status plays a role in linguistic stratification; it is a multidimensional construct, one element being education
    * Indeed, there is some reason to think that educational attainment might be particularly important for our understanding of local sound change
    * Traditional way to operationalize it: college vs. not
    * Prichard & Tamminga's alternative
    * Outline
3. Short-a in Philadelphia
    A. Classic descriptions
        * History of the system
        * Ferguson
        [Ferguson rule here]
        * Labov
        * the sC controversy
    B. The FAVE system
        * tenser + V
        * following /l/
        * sC clusters
    C. Our approach
        * Methodology
        * Data
        * sC results
        * Lexical results
        [tables of results, with respect to FAVE "mistakes"]
4. The retreat from Philadelphia short-a
    A. Labov et al. 2013 on this
        * What they said
        * Problematize that
    B. Results
        * DOB
        * Years of education
        * Educational level
        [lots of tables and graphs]
    C. Discussion
        * Social stratification of the change in progress
        * Consistency with hypotheses about educational attainment effects
5. A comparison with (eyF)
    A. The variable
        * Definition
        * Labov 2001; Labov et al. 2013
    B. Results
        * DOB
        * Years of education
        * Educational level
        [lots of tables and graphs]
    c. Dicussion
        * Change without socioeconomic stratification?
        * Difference in salience?
6. Conclusion
    * Education results
    * New ways of quantifying morphological/lexical sound change
